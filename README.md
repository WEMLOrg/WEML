### With Empathy, More Love
This is an app we created with the elderly needs in mind, for our Inovative Programming course. 

Here they can:
- Get AI-powered possible diagnosis based on symptoms they provide
- Take quizes designed to help cognitive abilities
- Read uplifting articles
- Send regular emails to the doctor and the family of the user with symptoms they entered
- Have a safe space to journal their experiences
- See all their symptoms over time in a calendar

  

Check out the demo video and the powerpoint for more info :)
